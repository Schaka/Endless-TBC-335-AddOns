# Endless-TBC-335-AddOns
AddOns for Endless' 3.3.5a client based TBC server.

I don't play on the server and have very little intention to do so. Just trying to provide some basic addons for people to work with.
Please don't make requests for me to port anything over. If there's something I want to port over, I will.
If there's something you absolutely need ported, my rate is 50â‚¬/hour.

Not all of these are originally mine. If you don't see my name in the .toc file, it's someone else's and I only did minimal work to fix it.

## Important notes
- PlateCastbars is pretty unperformant, but works EVERYWHERE in the world and is best used in combination with disabling nameplate castbar in your interface settings
- rais_ArenaCastbar is for arenas only, way more performant and my recommendation if you don't need castbars in BGs/open world. DO NOT use them together
- **Some AddOns WILL require you to go into the settings and actually set them up, default settings may not be the most sensible**
- I chose to add TBC functionality to an existing 3.3.5a Gladius- if someone actually wanted to port Gladdy (Classic) to the 3.3.5a client, it would be a bigger undertaking but better result
- If you had a previous version of ArenaLive installed, you might have to go into /alive => Party Frames and enable "Show in party"
