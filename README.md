# Endless-TBC-335-AddOns
AddOns for Endless' 3.3.5a client based TBC server.

I don't play on the server and have very little intention to do so. Just trying to provide some basic addons for people to work with.
Please don't make requests for me to port anything over. If there's something I want to port over, I will.
If there's something you absolutely need ported, my rate is 50â‚¬/hour.

Not all of these are originally mine. If you don't see my name in the .toc file, it's someone else's and I only did minimal work to fix it.
Credit for Gladdy goes to all the maintainers who came before and after me.

## Important notes
- Gladdy REQUIRES ClassicAPI. You cannot run it without
- Gladdy adds a few things as per usual - like ArenaCountDown, I don't recommend using both
- Gladdy and Gladius are obviously conflicting, but I wanted to offer both options
- PlateCastbars is pretty unperformant, but works EVERYWHERE in the world and is best used in combination with disabling nameplate castbar in your interface settings
- rais_ArenaCastbar is for arenas only, way more performant and my recommendation if you don't need castbars in BGs/open world. DO NOT use them together
- **Some AddOns WILL require you to go into the settings and actually set them up, default settings may not be the most sensible**
- If you had a previous version of ArenaLive installed, you might have to go into /alive => Party Frames and enable "Show in party"
